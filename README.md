Immediate Demand:

There is a growing need for solutions that integrate real-time data analysis in critical missions, especially for military and police forces. The use of advanced technology for threat recognition and decision support in high-risk environments is essential to ensuring safety and effectiveness.

Scalability:

SITAI (Intelligent System for Analysis and Interpretation) is designed to be modular, starting with essential functionalities like threat recognition in videos. Over time, the system can expand to areas such as strategic mapping, data integration from various sources, and real-time decision support.

Ease of Validation:

SITAI can be quickly validated in simulated environments, such as training scenarios, before being deployed in real situations. This approach reduces risks and ensures the systemâ€™s effectiveness in controlled conditions.

Foundation for Other Projects:

SITAI provides a strong base for future projects, such as the Augmented Reality Training Simulator (STAR) or the Autonomous Mission Management System (SGMA). Its modularity and flexibility allow it to be expanded or integrated into other technologies as needed.

Next Steps for Development:

Defining Initial Scope:

Begin with basic functionality, such as video threat recognition.
The system will identify suspicious objects, like weapons, and highlight abnormal movements in real time.
System Architecture:

Backend: Utilize Python and libraries like TensorFlow and OpenCV for data processing.
Frontend: Create a simple interface to display data and analysis results.
Modular Development:

Module 1: Video and image processing for threat recognition.
Module 2: Mapping and geolocation analysis for strategic support.
Module 3: Decision support with automated reports.
Testing and Feedback:

Perform testing in real and simulated environments with feedback from target users to improve the system.
Gradual Expansion:

After validation, expand SITAI to include features such as team communication, drone integration, and other advanced technologies.
Required Technologies:

Programming: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV.
Mapping and Geolocation: Google Maps API, QGIS.
Cloud Infrastructure: AWS or Azure.
Security: Advanced encryption tools.
